## About The Project

This project is a creative exploration of web animations and user interface design. By leveraging the power of [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/), I have developed smooth, high-performance animations that enhance the user experience.

 Key Features:
- Smooth Animations:** Advanced animations using GSAP.
- Responsive Design:** Seamless experience across devices.
- Modern UI/UX: Inspired by the Miranda website for a clean, contemporary look.


To run this project locally, all you need is a modern web browser. If you want to tweak the code, you can use any code editor (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
